# Introduction to NumPy

### What is NumPy?
NumPy is a Python library. NumPy stands for Numerical Python and it provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects and is helpful for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation, etc.

### Why study NumPy if we have Python lists?
There are numerous advantages of using NumPy over Python list:<br>

- Size or Memory - NumPy data structures take up less space!
- Performance - NumPy Arrays are faster than Python lists
- Functionality - NumPy have optimized functions such as linear algebra operations built in.

### What will we cover in this tutorial?
- Installation of NumPy
- Most Useful Function
- Creating Arrays
- Manipulating and comparing Arrays
- Reshaping and Transposing
- Sorting Arrays
- Turning an IMAGE into NumPy Array
